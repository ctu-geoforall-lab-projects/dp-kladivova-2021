# Master Thesis

## Title

Creation of a new GRASS GIS startup mechanism

## Description

The GRASS GIS startup mechanism could discourage new users from
further working with this software or at least making it
uncomfortable. This master thesis is built on the programming part
performed in the summer of 2020 within the international Google Summer
of Code program (GSoC) and uses two questionnaires to evaluate the
benefits of significant changes that have taken place. The first part
of the work focuses on a survey among intermediate users and compares
the startup mechanism of the original GRASS GIS 7.8 version with the
new solution introduced after GSoC.  The second part is focused on
newcomers and implements the special mode for first-time users.  A
survey based on a simple task further examines whether the user's
initial contact with the software when using the first-time mode is
more pleasant or not.
