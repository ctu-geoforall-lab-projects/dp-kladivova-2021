13;Nov 27 2020 12:48 AM;I will create a new Location. ;Not sure I need a world map to start with, even though I don't dislike the idea. I am a ~experienced Grass user, so I'd create a location with the proper projection that differs from WGS84 if needed (and maybe a less wide region than the whole world?), but I am not sure that a first time user would give much weight to the warning.;P;100

21;Nov 26 2020 8:58 PM;I will try to find a function to import data somewhere. ;The note says we are in linwe mapset but we are seeing a map that is in PERMANENT. Will this map display by default when a user first open grass? If yes, message should change. And maybe it should also say something about create a new location with the CRS of user's data and importing with reprojection;P;80
