8;Nov 27 2020 7:15 AM;25;Too much text in the info bar;P;99;
9;Nov 27 2020 6:53 AM;50;I did not pay attention to the infobars, to be honest.;B;25;
10;Nov 27 2020 3:04 PM ;75;One way to improve the help / introduction could be a sample tutorial on how to solve this task with Otava. Eg: Click there and there, create a project, load data from a given place, there and there you will find a search function that you will use with this parameter. (Said very simply :-D.);B;0;
11;Nov 27 2020 01:05 PM;50;Maybe some additional pop ups to direct the user to the module tab;B;3;

14;Nov 27 2020 12:25 AM;65;Maybe discuss content of the infobars in a separate PR?;P;100;

17;Nov 27 2020 6:40 AM ;83;"The initial info box contains IMHO too much text. People are lazy to read...
Additionally, the term ""location"" might be abandoned in favour of ""project"" or the like, to make it less strange right away.
PS: cool to gather opinions with the surveys!! Much appreciated";P;100;
18;Nov 26 2020 4:46 PM;0;"I didn't read Info Bars, it looks like warning instead of advice. I would consider moving Info Bars above the boxes, otherwise I will not read it as a user.
Ideally shorten, it's long enough.";I;5;

24;Nov 26 2020 4:46 PM;100;Info Bars are great, well done! The next step, rather than explaining words such as location, mapset, permanent, module, etc. in info bars, would be to directly rename them.;P;54;
