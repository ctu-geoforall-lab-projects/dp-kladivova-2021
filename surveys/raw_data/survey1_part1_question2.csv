27;Oct 23 2020 08:10 PM;What if the user deletes the demolocation? Is it created 'on the fly'? Also, the startup screen has some interesting information to the new user (what is a location / mapset). So maybe a wizard that creates the demolocation and explains what is a database / location / mapset would be interesting. That wizard could also have an option for advanced users to skip the intro and choose the correct location/mapset;

43;Oct 23 2020 02:00 PM;If it is easy to change the location or mapset once already within the new DataCatalog, I would suggest to bypass the startup screen and start in Demolocation. Then, if the user wants, it can create a new location or change to another location. If this is not easy (for newcomers), then I would suggest a modernized version of the startup screen.;
