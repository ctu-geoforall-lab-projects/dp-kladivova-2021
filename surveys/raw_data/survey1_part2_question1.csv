13;Oct 24 2020 12:09 PM;Yes
14;Oct 24 2020 12:27 PM;Yes, but in my experience, tutorials work best not when done once but when they are set up to be constantly referenced for small things. I would recommend a written and video tutorial that is linked to by these pop-ups rather than tutorial methods delivered to the user.
